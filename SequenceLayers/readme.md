# Advanced Sequence Layers
Advanced  Sequence Layers is an After Effects script that provides enhanced layer sequencing controls.

Although AE provides a ‘Sequence Layers’ command, its functionality is very limited and provides a confusing interface.

Layer sequencing is a commonly necessary task when working on motion graphics, animation, video work or any other work in AE. ASL can save you precious time by performing a tedious task automatically.

When you have many layers to sequence it can be really hard to get the even spacing right, and it can be a very time-consuming task. With ASL you can do it with very few and simple steps.

ASL provides an intuitive interface that is easy to understand, and if you are in trouble you can always undo and roll back to your previous state. 

#### ASL Features:
- Sequence as many layers as you want
- Define a custom time span between the first and last layers, and the script will re-order then evenly.
- You can decide if you want our sequence to start from the current playhead time or from the beginning of the composition. 
- Decide if you want to stack the layers in descending or ascending order.
- Set an amount of random if you feel that even spacing too rigid and want a more organic result.
- Extend the Out-Points of the selected layers to the end of the composition
- Reset all the layers to the beginning of your comp

#### Compatibility:
ASL has been tested on AE CC 2014 and 2015 in Mac OSX
No guarantee that it will run smoothly on Windows or in a different AE version. 
Compatibility list will be added as the script is tested on different versions.
